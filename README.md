Quiz Management Application
• Built a Java console-based quiz management system with MySQL database integration, implementing CRUD operations
on quiz questions, secure credential management via properties files, and quiz modules that load questions from the
database.
• Developed an interactive, menu-driven console interface for quiz administration, enabling seamless operations for adding,
updating, and deleting quizzes, conducting exams, and calculating scores based on user responses.
